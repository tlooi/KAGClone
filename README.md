# KAGClone

Just something I built when I was bored sometime in 2021 using WebGL, WebSockets, and Express.
This was originally being built as a clone of King Arthur's Gold.

INSTRUCTIONS: Press Space to build, Click to delete blocks, and wasd to move around.
NOTE: Hosted in Singapore so delay is quite bad.
